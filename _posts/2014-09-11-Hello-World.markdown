So I've finally finished my M.Sc. in Computing Science at Imperial
College London. A friend suggested I start up a blog to keep track of
my projects, here it is!

Expect more posts in the future, after I've had some time to chill out
and started making progress on some of the side projects I'm
collaborating on.
